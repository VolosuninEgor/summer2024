# summer2024 
- this is my little report card summer 2024, in which I will report on the work I have done every day. 

To begin with, my plans:

### Boosting my thinking.
   One of the main tasks is to develop rational thinking in oneself with all that follows. I have a list of references for this:   
   ✅ 1. Harry Potter and methods of rationality (Eliezer Yudkowsky)    
   ⛔ 2. Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes (Maria Konnikova)  
   ⛔ 3. Rationalty: From AI to Zombies (Eliezer Yudkowsky)                
   ⛔ 4. Thinking, Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)                         
   ⛔ 5. Think like a mathematician (Barbara Oakley)                      
    
### Mathematics.
   Now my main weakness is at least 2 hours a day.

### Programming.
   One of the main goals of this summer, along with thinking. Learn how to program and figure out how everything works. At least 2 hours a day.
