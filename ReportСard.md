It turns out that the fromthetransistor course has a website, which greatly simplifies everything, because I thought that absolutely everything would have to be found and searched for myself, but this is not the case. I'm starting to work hard in this direction, but I'm not doing any math yet.

There is little interest in studying use mathematics, I think this way I will not do anything, I want something more applied, such as Bayesian probability or close to programming, I need interest, preparation for the use does not give it. I'm slowly starting a course from George Hotz, let's see where it leads.

I'm starting my studies today. Another goal that came to my mind is to love mathematics. Today I started to thin out some assignments and realized how dumb I am in math. For a while I will concentrate on the Unified State Exam in mathematics, solve and understand the topics, but at the same time I want to look at more native topics of mathematics in computer science. I will focus on probability theory for the first few days

This is first day, today I am setting up this repository and starting to implement the plan (2 hours of mathematics and programming each).
I am considering the option of preparing for the Unified State Exam as a math class. On the one hand, there is less interest, on the other hand, there is a great practical benefit.

Today was a fasting day. I wanted to watch the rest of the series, but it didn't work out, I'm limited to 4 episodes for the next few days, it takes too much time. I will start doing business in the morning so that I can be free in the evening. So far, so good.
The desire to study the Unified State Exam is not enough, you need to overcome yourself somehow.
