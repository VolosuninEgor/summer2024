# Report card by day

## June 3
I'm finishing a course on verilog, but UART seems to be flying again, but the day was spent productively anyway. I created a repository for notes, it's time to get down to pumping thinking. It has come to realize how valuable these days without school are, you need to spend it wisely and enjoy every moment of freedom.

## June 2
A little dancing with a tambourine, due to the fact that I connected the repository to git and/or github, I can't emulate the work, but I just created a separate folder that is not linked to the repository and already test the code there, after which I upload it to the main folder and push it to the repository.
I found an example of the UART code, today I will start to disassemble it, tomorrow I will finish and start writing on my own 

## June 1
The first day of summer, from now on I get involved in active work! Today I will work on the verilog on the Hardware Description Language Programming (Verilog) playlist and I will already start doing UART, which should have been done 3 days ago, I am behind schedule. I also started to master git and github at least at a basic level
One o'clock in the morning, due to the fact that there were some problems with the code simulation, the UART is in flight again today, tomorrow I will not allow this

## May 31 
I didn't have any serious studies today, I'll fix it tomorrow, but I practiced the verilog syntax and found a way to emulate it using icarus verilog and GTKwave, which opens up new possibilities. My small morning classes at the local university are over and I will be able to start the fromthetransistor course with full strength. Tomorrow is the first day of summer, this is the key moment!

## May 30
For the most part, I solved problems in python and c++, tomorrow I will understand verilog and UART, I have left serious mathematics for now, for general development I watch videos like 3blow1brown, Math, etc. While I'm reading Maria Konnikova, it's very informative

## May 29
There are problems with installing Verilator on Windows, as I understand it, everyone has difficulties with this, so far it is not critical, I will try to cope without it, tomorrow I will work with UART and Verilog syntax

## May 28
It turns out that the fromthetransistor course has a website, which greatly simplifies everything, because I thought that absolutely everything would have to be found and searched for myself, but this is not the case. I'm starting to work hard in this direction, but I'm not doing any math yet.

## May 27
There is little interest in studying use mathematics, I think this way I will not do anything, I want something more applied, such as Bayesian probability or close to programming, I need interest, preparation for the use does not give it. I'm slowly starting a course from George Hotz, let's see where it leads.

## May 26
I'm starting my studies today. Another goal that came to my mind is to love mathematics. Today I started to thin out some assignments and realized how dumb I am in math. For a while I will concentrate on the Unified State Exam in mathematics, solve and understand the topics, but at the same time I want to look at more native topics of mathematics in computer science. I will focus on probability theory for the first few days

## May 25
This is first day, today I am setting up this repository and starting to implement the plan (2 hours of mathematics and programming each).
I am considering the option of preparing for the Unified State Exam as a math class. On the one hand, there is less interest, on the other hand, there is a great practical benefit.

Today was a fasting day. I wanted to watch the rest of the series, but it didn't work out, I'm limited to 4 episodes for the next few days, it takes too much time. I will start doing business in the morning so that I can be free in the evening. So far, so good.
The desire to study the Unified State Exam is not enough, you need to overcome yourself somehow.
