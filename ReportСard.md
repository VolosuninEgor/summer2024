# Report card by day

## May 25
This is first day, today I am setting up this repository and starting to implement the plan (2 hours of mathematics and programming each).
I am considering the option of preparing for the Unified State Exam as a math class. On the one hand, there is less interest, on the other hand, there is a great practical benefit.

Today was a fasting day. I wanted to watch the rest of the series, but it didn't work out, I'm limited to 4 episodes for the next few days, it takes too much time. I will start doing business in the morning so that I can be free in the evening. So far, so good.
The desire to study the Unified State Exam is not enough, you need to overcome yourself somehow.
